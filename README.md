# Helmet Detection using Roboflow and Google Colab
ðŸª– Helmet Detection
ðŸ“‘ Overview

This project focuses on developing a computer vision model to detect helmets using deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to automate helmet detection, which is crucial for ensuring safety in environments like construction sites and roads.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook (HELMET_DETECTION.ipynb) and leverages common libraries in the deep learning ecosystem such as TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and NumPy.
ðŸ§  Features

    Helmet detection using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

    Real-time prediction on test images.

    Data preprocessing and augmentation for improved model performance.

    Evaluation of the trained model's performance using accuracy and loss metrics.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following libraries:

- **Roboflow API**: For connecting to the model.
- **ipywidgets**: For creating the image upload interface.
- **Pillow**: For image processing (drawing bounding boxes).
- **Matplotlib**: Optional for visualizing the predictions.

Install dependencies (for local execution or if running in a different environment):

```bash
pip install roboflow ipywidgets Pillow matplotlib
